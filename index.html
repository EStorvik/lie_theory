title: Lie Theory Spring 2024

<div class="content">
    <h1>Welcome to this course in Lie Theory!</h1>
    <p>During the spring of 2024 I will try to cover the very basics of Lie theory and hopefully we can get to a level
        where
        we see the usecases for Lie theory in robotics. As a small <b>disclaimer</b> I have some personal motivation
        from
        this as well:
    <ul>
        <li>I want to learn Lie theory myself. I am not well versed in this topic at all, and I see this as a perfect
            opportunity to learn.</li>
        <li>I want to see if we can have some local research collaboration that I can contribute to here at HVL in
            Førde.
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Course plan</h2>
    <p>
        The plan is to meet on Fridays from 10:15-12:00 in Fanaråken (room and time might change), with a digital option
        available (I will explore
        the
        use of the smart board).

    <h2>Course material</h2>
    <p>
        I will probably make my own notes for the lectures, but more importantly, I will follow the compendium of Brian
        Hall, that you can find <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math-ph/0005032">here</a>.
