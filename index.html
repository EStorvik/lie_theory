title: Lie Theory Spring 2024
---

<h1>Welcome to this course in Lie Theory for robotics!</h1>
<p>During the spring of 2024 I will try to cover the very basics of Lie theory and hopefully we can get to a level where
    we see the usecases for Lie theory in robotics. As a small <b>disclaimer</b> I have some personal motivation from
    this as well:
<ul>
    <li>I want to learn Lie theory myself. I am not well versed in this topic at all, and I see this as a perfect
        opportunity to learn.</li>
    <li>I want to see if we can have some local research collaboration that I can contribute to here at HVL in Førde.
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>Course plan</h2>
<p>
    The plan is to have a weekly meeting where we go through the material together. I will try to make a hybrid solution
    where the prefered option is for everyone to be in the room, but it should be possible to join remotely as well (in
    particular for those of you that live in Sogndal). I will try to book Nygård in Førde for the meetings, but we
    should agree upon a time first.
